# Hi, I'm Minh Nguyen ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring software engineer currently studying Computer Science at UC Davis (graduating in 2025). Iâ€™m passionate about building creative and scalable software solutions that make an impact across web and mobile platforms. From machine learning models predicting wildfires to retro-themed arcade websites, I love bringing ideas to life through code.

### ðŸŒŸ What I Do
- **Full-Stack Development:** I work across both frontend and backend, developing user-friendly, responsive apps and websites. Currently, Iâ€™m working on a social media app for pet owners at Life of Kai, where Iâ€™m using Swift, UIKit, and Firebase to build features like pet profiles, animal sightings via Google Maps, and private messaging.
  
- **Machine Learning:** I've dabbled in machine learning projects like wildfire prediction, where I used Python, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow to create models that help with resource allocation and response planning.

- **Web Apps & Games:** I enjoy developing web apps and doing front end development, as well as smaller game projects with Godot engine!
- 
### ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Proficient: C++, Java, Swift | Intermediate: Python, JavaScript, Go, HTML, CSS, SQL, GDScript
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Node.js, Express, UIKit, CocoaPods, Firebase, TensorFlow, Git, and more!
- **Platforms:** I work with iOS, web, and cloud-based systems.

### ðŸ“š Currently Learning
Iâ€™m currently learning advanced Swift programming and game programming with Godot on the side.

### ðŸš€ Letâ€™s Collaborate
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other developers and designers to build meaningful projects. Feel free to check out my work and get in touch!
